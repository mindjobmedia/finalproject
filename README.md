Final Project: mindjobmedia.com

This is my personal website portfolio. As a freelance web and graphic designer I always need a website to show off my work and give out contact information. 

Over the years I was never able to build out my website, only design it and then hand it off to a developer. With the help of a developer/friend as 
a mentor, I was able to build this website, www.mindjobmedia.com using what I learned in BootCamp: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, including an .on('click',
function(event).

Although this class was very difficult for me, it pushed me to learn more of what I enjoyed which is HTML and CSS. The JS, JSON, SQL, etc, was always over
my head. So I kept it pretty simple for my final project. 

I hope you like. Thank you.
